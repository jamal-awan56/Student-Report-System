# ðŸŽ“ Student Score Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based student score prediction system that estimates final exam scores based on various performance indicators. It demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques for educational analytics.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
  - Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score)
  - Score prediction based on input features

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts student performance using real-world features like hours studied, attendance, and assignments
- Implements and compares multiple regression models
- Visualizes data trends to support model interpretation
- Includes model performance metrics for validation

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NumPy

## ðŸ“Š Example Use Case

This system can be used by:
- Teachers to forecast student outcomes
- Education administrators to identify at-risk students early
- Students to understand which factors influence their academic performance
