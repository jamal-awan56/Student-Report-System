Step 1: Data Cleaning and Basic Visualization Load the Dataset: First, you need to load the dataset from the provided Kaggle link. You can use libraries like pandas to read the data.

Inspect the Data: Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values or incorrect data types. You may need to convert data types or fill in missing values.

Basic Visualization: Use libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to visualize the relationship between study hours and exam scores. A scatter plot can be useful here.

Step 2: Split the Dataset Feature Selection: Select the relevant features for your model. In this case, you will use study hours as the independent variable (feature) and exam scores as the dependent variable (target).

Train-Test Split: Use train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Step 3: Train a Linear Regression Model Import the Model: Use LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.

Fit the Model: Train the model using the training data.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

Step 4: Visualize Predictions and Evaluate Model Performance Visualize Predictions: Create a scatter plot of the actual vs. predicted exam scores to see how well the model performs.

Evaluate Model Performance: Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance
